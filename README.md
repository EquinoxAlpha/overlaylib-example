This is an example project showing how to use some [overlaylib](https://github.com/EquinoxAlpha/overlaylib) features.

The demo includes a label that bounces around the screen, a FPS counter, rainbow text and a image of a squirrel (to test texture support)

The aforementioned picture of a squirrel was sourced from [here](https://www.pexels.com/photo/photo-of-squirrel-holding-nut-during-daytime-47359/) (CC0).

The resolution is hardcoded as 2560x1600.
